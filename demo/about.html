                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>At STEM SCHOOL (STEM Program Training and Development Services), we are dedicated to transforming STEM education in the Philippines. With alarming results from PISA 2018 and 2022, which placed Filipino students among the lowest in mathematics, science, and reading comprehension globally, it is clear that the country faces a crisis in education. Deficiencies in STEM competency, ineffective teaching methods, inadequate learning materials, and economic barriers continue to hinder studentsâ€™ ability to think critically, solve problems, and prepare for future careers.</p>
                <p>Our mission is to bridge these gaps by providing innovative STEM learning solutions that empower students, educators, and institutions. We develop comprehensive, research-backed, and industry-aligned STEM programs to enhance learning outcomes and foster a generation of skilled problem-solvers.</p>
